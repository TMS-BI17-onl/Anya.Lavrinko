Color is not needed in the SELECT. After adding it to select, you had to add it to GROUP BY and it gave you incorrect result.
Correct answer:
SELECT  ProductSubcategoryID,
		MIN(Weight) AS Min_weight, 
		MAX(Size) AS Max_size
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
